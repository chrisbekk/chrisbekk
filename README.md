<h2>About me</h2>
I am a student at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media where I study frontend development.
I have an interest in all things regarding the development process, from planning and designing to coming up with solutions that help solve real-life problems.
I believe in adopting technologies that make the development process more intuitive, while keeping the user experience engaging.

<h2>Interests</h2>
I've always enjoyed learning new things, and this is something I carry over into coding as well. At the moment I'm getting into the following technologies:
<ul>
  <li>ThreeJS</li>
  <li>ReactJS</li>
  <li>Java</li>
</ul>

At the moment I'm tinkering with 3D through the ThreeJS library, and might get into Blender at some point. I like incorporating interactive experiences in my apps, and ThreeJS is a nice way of achieving this. I've also started learning Java in order to get a better understanding of programming in general, and will most likely branch out into C# or C++ at some point.

<h2>About me</h2>
I am a student at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media where I study frontend development.
I have an interest in all things regarding the development process, from planning and designing to coming up with solutions that help solve real-life problems.
I believe in adopting technologies that make the development process more intuitive, while keeping the user experience engaging.

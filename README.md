<h2>About me</h2>
I am a student at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media where I study frontend development.
I have an interest in all things regarding the development process, from planning and designing to coming up with solutions that help solve real-life problems.
I believe in adopting technologies that make the development process more intuitive, while keeping the user experience engaging.

<h2>Learning</h2>
I've always enjoyed learning new things, and this is something I carry over into coding as well. At the moment I'm getting into the following technologies:
<ul>
  <li>ThreeJS</li>
  <li>Astro</li>
  <li>Firebase</li>
  <li>Svelte</li>
</ul>

I'm particularly excited about Astro, as it provides flexibility and an easy way of making websites. I also enjoy learning Svelte; I think frontend development is obsessed with Javascript frameworks that introduce too much unnecessary code and logic, but I think the team at Svelte is doing alot of things right, as they have gone for a more lightweight approach. Combining Astro and Svelte seems to me like a good combination for my projects going forwards.
